# CISC275 Garden Designer

The Garden Designer program is a multi-faceted program that serves to educate the user 
about Delaware native plants and leps. It then allows a user to create 
a garden using the knowledge they have learned which can ultimately be used in the real world. 
Such a garden is created by the use of various features
 including setting budgets, free-form garden plot creation and multiple settings for temperature, soil, moisture and budget. Along with 
customizing a garden itself, a user will also have access to a vast collection of 100 plants and leps to choose
 from, all of which are native to the Mt. Cuba area and are accompanied with both scientific and common names.
